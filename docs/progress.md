# Progress

## M0 — Foundations (2026-10-12)

**Status: done, except the two-host LAN transport run, which needs a second machine.**

### What exists

- **Monorepo:** pnpm workspaces, strict TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, and CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). CI runs `pnpm check` on Linux, macOS and Windows, a loopback transport run, and a Docker job that builds the stack and moves 1 GiB between containers.
- **`@communal/protocol`:** zod schemas for every hub message (both directions) and every peer frame, the JSON envelope with version/unknown-type/direction handling, and the msgpack peer frame codec with a streaming decoder. Additions to the HANDOFF catalog are in ADR 0004.
- **`@communal/crypto`:**
  - device keys, `device_id`, `user_id` and fingerprints
  - domain-separated signatures
  - device certs, chain verification and revocation
  - safety codes
  - recovery keys (Argon2id + XChaCha20-Poly1305 file, and 24-word BIP39)
  - hub transfer tokens
- **Transport test build** (`spike/transport`): udx-native + Noise XX with device keys and cert-chain verification (ADR 0001).
- **Docker:** `docker/hub.Dockerfile`, `docker/headless.Dockerfile`, `docker/compose.dev.yml`. The hub and CLI are skeletons. The hub sends `challenge`, answers `ping`, serves `/healthz` and runs the two UDP NAT-probe responders. The CLI's `communal daemon` and `status` commands create and show the device key.

### Demo

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm check                       # 96 tests
pnpm spike:transport                              # 1 GiB over loopback
pnpm dev:stack                                    # hub + alice + bob
docker compose -f docker/compose.dev.yml exec node-a communal status
# 1 GiB between containers (start both; order doesn't matter):
docker compose -f docker/compose.dev.yml exec node-a communal-spike peer --me alice --peer bob --role up --port 41641 --peer-addr node-b:41642
docker compose -f docker/compose.dev.yml exec node-b communal-spike peer --me bob --peer alice --role down --port 41642 --peer-addr node-a:41641
```

### Done criteria

- [x] Schemas round-trip in tests (every type has a fixture; the test fails if one is missing).
- [x] 1 GiB between two processes on localhost with mutual key auth: ~125 MB/s, integrity check passed.
- [x] 1 GiB between two containers in the dev stack: ~287 MB/s, integrity check passed.
- [ ] 1 GiB across two hosts on a LAN. **Needs a second machine.** Run `communal-spike peer …` on each host, or `pnpm --filter @communal/spike-transport exec tsx --conditions=@communal/source src/bench.ts peer …` from a checkout, with `--peer-addr <other-host-ip>:<port>`.

### Known gaps, carried forward

- **Hub TLS:** `COMMUNAL_DEV_TLS=self-signed` is not implemented yet, so the hub serves plain `ws://` on 8443. This lands in M1 along with hub-key pinning.
- **Image sizes:** 370 MB (hub) and 406 MB (headless) uncompressed, against the ~300 MB target. Most of that is the `node:24-bookworm-slim` base. Revisit when ffmpeg/sharp are added (M6). A distroless or Alpine base depends on prebuilds for udx-native and sharp.
- **Images built and tested only for linux/arm64** (Apple Silicon). The CI docker job builds amd64. Multi-arch publishing comes with M9 packaging.
- **The headless image doesn't include ffmpeg yet.** That comes with the thumbnail pipeline (M6).
- **`packages/core` and `apps/desktop` are empty placeholders.**
